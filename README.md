## Setting up

For easy and consistent development, we are using a `devcontainer`. For for information about devcontainers, check out this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

The first step is to install the necessary prerequisites. These are:

- Visual Studio Code
- Remote - Containers extension for VSCode
- Docker

For installing docker on Ubuntu, follow this guide: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Be sure to also follow the post-installation steps, located here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

If you're using Windows and still on WSL 1, use this guide: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly

Once you have these prereqs, then you're good to go! Clone the repo and open it in VSCode. You should see a popup in the bottom right prompting you to reopen the project in a container. Go ahead and click that. If you didn't, you can open up the VSCode "Command Palette" and search for "Rebuild and Reopen in Container".
